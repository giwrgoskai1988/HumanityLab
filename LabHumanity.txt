Project Humanity!
We will model Students and Workers.
1. Every Student should have firstName, lastName, and a
 faculty number
2. Every Worker should have firstName, lastName, week salary and
work hours per day.
3. Our software should be able to calculate the money he earns
 by hour.
4. Print the Student info in the following format:
	First Name : {Student's First Name} 
	Last Name : {Student's Last Name}
	Faculty Number : {Student's Faculty Number}
5. Print the worker info in the following format:
	First Name : {Worker's First Name} 
	Last Name : {Worker's Last Name}
	Week Salary : {Worker's Week Salary}
	Hours Per Day : {Worker's working hours}
	Salary Per Hour : {Worker's salary per hour}

Constraints:
First Name: Should start with a capital letter, should be more 
than 2 characters
Last Name: Should start with a capital letter, should be more 
than 3 characters
Faculty Number: Should be in Range [5...10]
Week Salary: Should be more than 10
Working Hours: Should be in Range [1...12]

Print exactly two digits after every double value's 
decimal operator.

Consider workweek from Monday to Friday.

A Faculty Number should be consisted only of digits and letters.AD444D

FirstName and LastName must always be submitted. If first letter
is not a capital, our software must fix it.

At the end do not forget to print how many workers exist
 in our program.
